\title{Example object that is output from \code{tangles} function.}
\description{This output that would be derived from the \code{tangles} function. It contains the instructions for anonymization of associated point pattern or raster data, or the re-identify tangled data.}
\usage{data(detangler_data)}

\format{
\code{detangler_data} is a \code{list} with 3 elements. The first element is a unique hash key for tracking data processing provenance. The second element contains the integer sequence of steps that were used to anonymize a given data sets. There are 3 possible anonymizing procedures: shift vertical (1), shift (horizontal), and rotate (3). The last element is a \code{data.frame} that encodes the values to perform either anonymization or re-identification, given the particular anonymization step used.}


\note{This data is the sort of output that one would expect when the \code{tangles} function is used.}
